In order to make an objective conclusion about the \"truth\", we conduct a hypothesis test.\n",

    "We're often interested in estimating a population parameter by calculating a statistic from a sample. However, sampling will always result in some degree of uncertainty. A sample captures a small subset of the population, so we can never be sure that a statistic (computed from only one sample) captures the complete truth. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can learn more about the population by going back and taking more samples. However, sampling is a very costly process and we don't always have the resources to collect more samples from the population. Instead, when we have a large representative sample of the population, we can create new samples by sampling with replacement from the original sample in a process called *bootstrapping*.  By the law of averages, the distribution of the original sample is likely to resemble the population, and the distributions of all the \"resamples\" are likely to resemble the original sample. Therefore, the distributions of all the resamples are likely to resemble the population as well.\n",

    "We calculate one statistic for each of our new bootstrap samples. By combining all of them, we can produce a confidence interval for the population parameter. We use this interval to estimate the parameter to some degree of confidence (typically 95%). A confidence level of 95% means that we can be 95% confident that the process resulted in a \"good\" interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, before we start the process of collecting a sample of data from the population and creating a new confidence interval, there is a 95% chance that the interval will contain the population parameter. If we were to create many new confidence intervals, around 95% of those intervals will contain the population parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that when a confidence interval has already been generated, it has either a 0% or 100% chance of containing the true population parameter. This is because the true population parameter isn't random: it's unknown, but it's fixed."
